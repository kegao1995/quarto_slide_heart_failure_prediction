### **Land Acknowledgement**

We would like to begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is the unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), Stó:lō and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil- Waututh) Nations.

### **What is our Project?**

- Availability of electronic medical records from patients with heart failure collected during follow-up care. 
- Use this data to create a model that predicts whether a patient with heart failure will die or survive.

### **Why does it matter?**

- improve clinical decision-making
- ease workload of doctors
- enhance patient care

### **Presentation Outline**

---

### **Dataset Overview**
The dataset used for this analysis consists of 299 patients, including 105 women and 194 men aged between 40 and 95 years. It includes 13 clinical, body, and lifestyle features, such as age, anemia status, blood parameters, and follow-up duration. The target variable, `DEATH_EVENT`, indicates whether a patient survived or passed away during the follow-up period, which averaged 130 days.

---

Key challenges with this dataset:

- **Small sample size**: Only 299 rows.
- **Class imbalance**: 67.89% of patients survived, while only 32.11% passed away, making it crucial to address imbalance during modeling.

---

### **Exploratory Data Analysis**
Our analysis revealed the following:

- No missing values in the dataset, eliminating the need for imputation.
- Low correlations between features, indicating no significant multicollinearity issues.

Key features included:

- **Ejection fraction**: The percentage of blood ejected from the heart during contraction.
- **Serum creatinine**: Indicates kidney function and has implications for heart health.

---

<small>The following plot @fig-death-event-distributions illustrate the probability density distributions of key features in the dataset, categorized by the outcome of the **Death Event** variable (True = patient passed away, False = patient survived). </small>

![Analyzing Feature Distributions by Death Event](figure/Analyzing_Feature_Distributions_by_Death_Event.svg){#fig-death-event-distributions fig-width=15 fig-align="center"}

---

- **Time:** Patients who survived (False) tend to have longer follow-up periods compared to those who passed away (True).
- **Serum Sodium:** Higher serum sodium levels appear to correlate with better survival rates.
- **Ejection Fraction:** Patients with higher ejection fraction percentages are more likely to survive.

---

### **Data Preprocessing**
- **Data Split:** Train size = 0.8 | Test size = 0.2
- **Column Transformer:** 
   - StandardScaler() on numeric columns, such as age and time
   - OneHotEncoder() on binary columns, such as diabetes and smoking

---

### **Correlations Matrix**
- The following plot illustrates the correlations between all features:

![](figure/correlation_heatmap.png){fig-width=15 fig-align="center"}

---

### **Correlation Matrix (continue)**
The correlations between all pairs of the features are below 0.5:

- No anomalous correlations between features
- No need to drop any of the features

---

### **Modeling Approach**
We compared three algorithms:

- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression 

---

### **Cross Validation**
- Decision Tree:
![](figure/Decision_Tree_CV.png){fig-width=50%}
   - <span style="color:red">overfitting</span>
   - <span style="color:red">sensitive to small data changes</span>
   - <span style="color:red">bias towards dominant classes in unbalanced datasets</span>

---

### **Cross Validation(continue)** 
- KNN and Logistic Regression:
   - GridSearchCV
   - results:
   
| **Model**              | **Mean test score**               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **KNN**                | 0.777899 (with n_neighbors = 19)  |
| **Logistic Regression**| 0.828261 (with C = 0.0001)        |

   - Best model: <span style="color:blue">Logistic Regression model</span>

---

### **Hyperparameter Tuning** 
**(Logistic Regression)**

<small>
The best regularization parameter is C = 0.0001, with a cross-validation score of 0.83.
The model generalizes well without overfitting.

---

### **Model Selection**
We selected the Logistic Regression model due to its:

- Interpretability
- Robustness with smaller datasets
- Probability outputs

### **Performance Matrices**

- Captures majority of the high-risk patients, moderately accurate, conservative
- Recall = True Positive Rate = 74%

## Why do we want to improve recall?

### **Challenges with Healthcare Data**

Patient Data is:


           Scarce            Incomplete              
      Hidden (confidencial)    Messy
      Imbalanced class       Inconsistent

### **This is a lot!**

---

### **Proposed Improvements **

- Collect higher-quality patient data 
- Include diverse features (genetic predispositions, lifestyle factors, doctor's notes)
- Experiment with ensemble models or Neural Networks
